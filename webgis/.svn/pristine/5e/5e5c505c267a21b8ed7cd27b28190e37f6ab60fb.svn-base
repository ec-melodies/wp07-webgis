<p align="justify">The Desertification Susceptibility indicator is produced by intersecting the LULC
    previously
    described with space/time’ climatic and biophysical (which are mainly related to vegetation and soil
    components) intermediate indicators:</p>

<p align="justify">For producing the above indicator, in a first step, it is necessary to compute the
    following
    variables with the data provided by the users:</p>

<ul>
    <li>RL1 - number of days per year with precipitation below 1 mm;</li>
    <li>Soil Brightness – the relation between NIR band and the RED band;</li>
    <li>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">With the previous variables, a set of intermediate indicators are produced:</p>

<ul>
    <li align="justify">Local drought degradation [C(x)] - trend of precipitation extremes (RL1), normalized
        to
        a range of [0-1]
        – values closer to 1 are more prone to become desertified;
    </li>
    <li align="justify">Local vegetation status [V(x)] – provides a reclassification of the vegetation
        status
        for each LULC
        pixel, within a range of [0-1] – vegetation with values closer to 1 are more similar to the
        vegetation
        identified areas where processes of desertification are more intensive;
    </li>
    <li align="justify">Local soil status [S(x)] - provides a reclassification of the soil status for each
        LULC
        pixel, within a
        range of [0-1] – soils with values closer to 1 are more similar to the soils identified in areas
        where
        processes of desertification are more intensive;
    </li>
    <li align="justify">Vegetation and Soil status [B(x)] – integration of the V(x) and S(x) in one unique
        intermediate
        indicator so as to emphasize, for each land cover region, the most relevant information from the
        intermediate V(x) and S(x) – land cover regions with values closer to 1 are more similar to regions
        identified in areas where processes of desertification are more intensive.
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The preliminary indicators C(x) and B(x) are then integrated so as to produce the final
    indicator of Susceptibility to Desertification I(x).</p>

<p align="justify">This final indicator provides, for each land cover patch, the susceptibility to
    desertification in terms of vegetation, soil and climate. I.e., a region with sparse vegetation with low
    vivacity, or a region with soil more exposed and low values of moisture, organic matter, etc.., may not
    be
    prone to desertification; however, if a land cover region has those characteristics and a climate prone
    to
    drought, it has a great tendency towards desertification.</p>
