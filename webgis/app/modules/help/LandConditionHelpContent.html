<p align="justify">First, the Area of Interest, time period, and spatial resolution are set according to the
    reporting needs of the application. Typically, those are, respectively, the whole countries, 10 years, and 1
    km. This is agreed between the end users demand on the one hand, and the SERVICE_DEVELOPER on the other
    hand.</p>

<p align="justify">The core computations are then run using the 2dRUE software library, written in the R
    language. Most of computational processes are transparent to the user, but attention and user input are
    required at certain identified points. For that reason, it is advisable that this part of the service is run
    either by the SERVICE_DEVELOPER or by expert technical users who have received appropriate training. Such
    core computations are illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p align="justify">The delineation of dry lands in the study area is done early in the process because they
    constitute the UNCCD spatial domain in terms of climatically affected areas. A classification of the
    FAO-UNEP aridity index is used to detect the target classes of Dry Sub-humid, Semi-arid and Arid zones. The
    basic fields of the climate archive are mean maximum, mean and mean minimum temperature, and precipitation.
    These are at a monthly resolution, and are used to compute yearly maps of the FAO-UNEP aridity index
    throughout the study period. This results in two maps summarizing the study period, one showing the average
    aridity, and another one showing fluctuations in the dry lands extension associated with inter-annual
    variations of aridity.</p>

<p align="justify">Then, archived time-series of a remotely-sensed vegetation index (e.g. Normalized Differences
    Vegetation Index, NDVI), and corresponding climate fields, are used to compute monthly estimates of Rain Use
    Efficiency (RUE) and yearly estimates of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), which support respectively the
    assessment and the monitoring components of Land Condition.</p>

<p align="justify">The assessment is based on comparing the vegetation performance of each location (i.e. the
    RUE of each grid-cell) to all others, synchronically during the study period. Ecological references are
    automatically generated through statistical methods. The result is a map of land states, the legend of which
    addresses levels of ecological maturity: </p>
<ol>
    <li><i>Underperforming anomaly</i></li>
    <li><i>Baseline performance</i></li>
    <li><i>Range performance: very degraded</i></li>
    <li><i>Range performance: degraded</i></li>
    <li><i>Range performance: productive</i></li>
    <li><i>Range performance: mature</i></li>
    <li><i>Reference performance</i></li>
    <li><i>Overperforming anomaly</i></li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">The monitoring is based on comparing the productivity (NPP) of each location to itself,
    diachronically over the study period. Effects of inter-annual variations of aridity, and of the course of
    time, are separated using a stepwise regression of NPP as a function of year number and year aridity, with
    as many points as the years in the time-series. After this, only effects of time are interpreted in terms of
    land degradation or progression, whilst simple responses to climate drift are considered as fluctuations
    with no impact in productivity trends. The result is a map of land trends, with a legend addressing
    especially shifts to degradation or maturity:</p>

<ol>
    <li><i>degrading</i></li>
    <li><i>fluctuating</i></li>
    <li><i>static</i></li>
    <li><i>improving</i></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">The assessment and monitoring maps are then combined in a final map of Land Condition, where
    the legend is hierarchical. A first term is made of land states, and a second one is made of land
    trends.</p>

<p align="justify">All the maps are in raster model and can be exported to any of the formats contained in the
    current version of the GDAL library. Tables and queries can be generated on demand, and facilities to adapt
    to the PRAIS format can be devised. Visualization is additionally facilitated by the conversion of the
    raster maps to KMZ format for their use with Google Earth or ArcGIS Explorer. </p>

<p align="justify">The new UNCCD indicator “Trends in land productivity or functioning of the Land” is
    explicitly addressed by the monitoring component of the Land Condition service. It makes the additional
    refinement to separate intrinsic trends of land productivity, which are truly associated with land
    degradation or land progression under ecological succession, from extrinsic trends related to climate
    drift.</p>
